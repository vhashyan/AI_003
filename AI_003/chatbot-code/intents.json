  "responses": ["A headache is described simply as a continuous pain in the head.\nA Migraine is defined as a recurrent throbbing headache that typically affects one side of the head and is often accompanied by nausea and disturbed vision.\nMigraines are the 3rd most common illness in the world.\nMigraines are not just simple pains in the head either,\nthe symptoms they can bring are\nvisual disturbances, nausea, vomiting, dizziness,\nextreme sensitivity to sound, light, touch and smell, and tingling or numbness in the extremities or face \n(https://migraineresearchfoundation.org).",
                "Headache is pain or discomfort in the head or face.\nHeadaches vary greatly in terms of the location and intensity of the pain, and how often the headaches occur.\nThe brain tissue doesn’t have pain-sensitive nerve fibers and doesn’t feel pain.\nBut, other parts of the head can be responsible for a headache too. Visit this site for more information about the headache (https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/migraine-headache/symptoms-causes/syc-20360201)",

    "Yes, hold on.\nTension headaches are the most common type of headache. Tension headache pain tends to be:\n-Consistent without throbbing.\n-Mild to moderate.\n-On both sides of the head (bilateral).\n-Responsive to over-the-counter treatment.\n-Worse during routine activities (such as bending over or walking upstairs).\n2Migraines are the second most common type of primary headaches. Symptoms of migraines include:\n-Moderate to severe pain.\n-Nausea or vomiting.\n-Pounding or throbbing pain.\n-Pain that lasts four hours to three days.\n-Sensitivity to light, noise or odors.\n-Stomach upset or abdominal pain.\n3Cluster headaches are the most severe type of primary headache.Cluster headaches come in a group or cluster, usually in the spring or fall.\nThey occur one to eight times per day during a cluster period, which may last two weeks to three months.\nThe headaches may disappear completely (go into remission) for months or years, only to recur later. The pain of a cluster headache is:\n-Intense with a burning or stabbing sensation.\n-Located behind one of your eyes or in the eye region, without changing sides.\n-Throbbing or constant.\n4Sinus headaches are the result of a sinus infection, which causes congestion and inflammation in the sinuses (open passageways behind the cheeks and forehead). People, and even healthcare providers, often mistake migraines for sinus headaches. Symptoms of sinus headaches include:\n-Bad taste in mouth.\n-Deep, constant pain in your cheekbones and forehead.\n-Facial swelling.\n-Feeling of fullness in ears.\n-Fever.\n-Pain that gets worse with sudden head movement or straining.\n-Mucus discharge (snot).\n5Most kids have had a headache by the time they get to high school. \nFor about 20% of them, tension headaches and migraines are a reoccurring problem.\nSimilar to adults, triggers for headaches in children include:\n-Certain foods that trigger headaches for the individual.\n-Changes in sleep.\n-Environmental factors.\n-Stress.\n6If you has any of these headache symptoms, get medical care right away:\n-A sudden headache\n-A headache that is associated with neurological symptoms such as:\n-Dizziness\n-Sudden loss of balance or falling\n-Numbness or tingling\n-Speech difficulties\n-Mental confusion\n-Seizures"]
